;; Commentary:
;;
;; Use the package associated with this file with the command "emacs
;; -q --load otlb-sample-init.el".  See the included README.md file
;; for more information on this package.
;;
;; Features that might be required by this library:
;;
;; Standard Emacs features, to be documented specificly later.  Also
;; requires features from https://github.com/akroshko/cic-emacs-common,
;; when installed appropriately using (require 'cic-emacs-common) is
;; sufficient.
;;
;; Has supporting bash and Python scripts also have their own
;; requirements, see the supporting README.md for more information.
